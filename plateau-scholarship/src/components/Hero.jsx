					The Scholarship Program is more than just financial aid—it is a
					lifeline for students striving to achieve their dreams of higher education.
					Designed with deep concern for the future of the State’s youth,
					this program aims to ease the burden of tuition fees, accommodation,
					and academic expenses, ensuring that no deserving student is left behind due to financial constraints.
					Through this initiative, the State Government and educational foundations stand in
					unwavering support of students, empowering them to focus on their studies,
					build their futures, and create a lasting impact on their communities.
